# Conway's Game of Life

Game of life has four simple rules

- A cell can have one of two states, dead or alive.
- If a living cell has less than two neighbors it dies of lonelyness.
- If a living cell has more than three neighbors it dies of overcrowding.
- If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors they procreate and that cell comes to life.
